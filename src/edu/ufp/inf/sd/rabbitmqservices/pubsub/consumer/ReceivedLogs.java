/**
 * Deliver message to multiple consumers (pattern known as "publish/subscribe").
 * <p>
 * Build a simple logging system with two programs:
 * - the first emits log messages and the second receives and prints them.
 * - every running copy of the receiver will get the messages (log messages
 * are going to be broadcasted to all receivers). One receiver directs logs to disk,
 * while another prints logs on the screen.
 * <p>
 * Exchanges:
 * A server never sends any messages directly to a queue, instead can only
 * send messages to an *exchange*.
 * The exchange receives messages to producers and pushes them to queues,
 * according the exchange type (cf. direct, topic, headers and fanout).
 * <p>
 * Listing exchanges:
 * To list the exchanges on the server you can run rabbitmqctl:
 * sudo rabbitmqctl list_exchanges
 * There will be amq.* exchanges and the default (unnamed or nameless) exchange
 * <p>
 * Temporary queues:
 * Previously we used queues with name (e.g. _01_hello and task_queue) to point
 * producers and workers to the same queue.
 * Now we want to hear about all log messages and the current flowing messages
 * not in the old ones. To solve that we need two things:
 * i) create an empty queue when connecting to rabbitmq
 * ii) once disconnect client, the queue should be automatically deleted
 * <p>
 * Binding:
 * tell the exchange to send messages to a queue (i.e. queue is interested in
 * messages MAIL_FROM_ADDR the exchange).
 * <p>
 * Listing bindings:
 * rabbitmqctl list_bindings
 * <p>
 * Running Receivers:
 * java -cp $CP ReceiveLogs > logs.log
 * java -cp $CP ReceiveLogs
